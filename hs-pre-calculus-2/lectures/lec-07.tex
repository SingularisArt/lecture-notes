\label{les_7:part_4_intro_to_trig_functions}

Recall that the sin and cos functions represent the coordinates of points in the
circumference of a unit circle. We found the values for $30^{\circ}$,
$45^{\circ}$, and $60^{\circ}$ by finding the coordinates of the points on the
circumference of the unit circle specified by these angles. The points we found
were all in Quadrant I, but since a circle is symmetric about both the $x$ and
$y$ axes, we can reflect these points about the coordinate axes to determine the
coordinates of corresponding points in the other quadrants. This means we can
use the sin and cos values of $\frac{\pi}{6}$, $\frac{\pi}{4}$, and
$\frac{\pi}{3}$ to find the sin and cos values of corresponding angles in other
quadrants.

Because of the symmetry of a circle, we can take a point in Quadrant I and
reflect it about the x-axis, the y-axis, and about both axes in order to obtain
corresponding points, one in each of the three other quadrants; the absolute
value of the coordinates of all four of these points is the same, i.e., they
only differ by their signs.

    \draw (1.4,-0.52) to node[right] {$\theta$} (1.4,0);

\end{figure}

Although all four of the points are specified by a different angle, all four of
the angles share the same reference angle, $\theta$.

\begin{definition}[Reference Angle]
  \label{def:reference_angle}

  The \textbf{reference angle} for an angle is the acute angle between the
  terminal side of the angle and the $x$-axis.
\end{definition}

\begin{exc}
  \label{exc:find_reference_angle_1}

  Find the reference angle for $150^{\circ}$ and $\frac{5\pi}{4}$.
\end{exc}

Now let's find out how we can use reference angles to determine the sin and cos
of any integer multiple of $\frac{\pi}{6}$, $\frac{\pi}{4}$ and
$\frac{\pi}{3}$.
